# How to Contribute

Please **create issues on GitHub** in order to report bugs, send feature
requests, send improvement suggestions or request help. If you've developed
really good git commits after forking ugtrain on GitHub, then please
**create pull requests** in order to request a review and merging your commits
into the mainline.

https://github.com/ugtrain/ugtrain

Please **star ugtrain** on GitHub if you like it and **watch it** if you would
like to get informed about issues and pull requests.

In case you don't like doing that via GitHub, just send an email to: <br/>
ugtrain-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

The SourceForge project is only there for having a mailing list, a blog,
a code mirror as well as rating and further promotion/SEO possibilities.

Note: All this has public archives. So please **don't** send anything illegal
(like configs for commercial games) there.
