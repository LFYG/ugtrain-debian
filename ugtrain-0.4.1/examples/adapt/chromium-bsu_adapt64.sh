# Tested with: chromium-bsu 0.9.14.1 .. 0.9.16.1

# We already know that chromium-bsu is a 64-bit C++ application. Therefore,
# objects are allocated most likely by the "_Znwm" function. This function
# calls malloc internally.
# And from previous discovery runs we already know the malloc size (288 or
# 0x120) for the HeroAircraft object.

# Should return something like this:

#  41108b:       48 89 1d fe 14 24 00    mov    %rbx,0x2414fe(%rip)        # 652590 <_ZTIPc+0x2f0>
#  411092:       e8 31 36 ff ff          callq  4046c8 <_Znwm@plt>
#  411097:       48 89 c7                mov    %rax,%rdi

# This shows us that 0x411097 is the relevant code address.
